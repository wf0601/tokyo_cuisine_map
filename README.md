# Tokyo Cuisine Map

As a Food Hunter used to be living in Tokyo, I collected information about many restaurants in Tokyo including all genres. 

This project can serve as your personal pocket guide to explore great food in Tokyo. You can mark the places you have visited, save your comments and reviews, and get your daily recommendations or use it as a search engine. 


You can simply build from source using docker

`docker build -t tokyo-cuisine-map`

`docker run -p 5004:5004`

Feel free to modify some setting in the config.
